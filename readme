This code works with the Sponge API which is for making Minecraft plugins.
I followed the directions at https://docs.spongepowered.org/ to set up the 
NetBeans IDE using Maven and the Sponge (coremod) version. When the plugin is 
added to the server it displays its name at start up in the console. It really 
just serves as a check that all the dependences are included before moving on 
to something a bit more useful.
